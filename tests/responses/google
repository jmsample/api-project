(General Data Protection Regulation), which is the EU\u2019s privacy and data protection requirements.<\/p>\n<p>In his complaint, Ryan raised concerns including that the RTB systems used by the two firms involves the unauthorised, and potentially unlimited disclosure and processing of personal data.<\/p>\n<p>His complaint contains several instances where he claims that Google and IAB have breached GDPR.<\/p>\n<p>The DPC is the state\u2019s supervisory authority in respect of GDPR and in respect of data controllers who main establishment is in Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>He also raised issues about the company\u2019s alleged inability to demonstrate their compliance with the GDPR requirement that personal data be processed lawfully and fairly, or that the processing of personal data be kept to a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>The High Court heard that the DPC opened an inquiry into RTB in May 2019, under its own violation, and there had been detailed correspondence between Ryan and the DPC over the matter.<\/p>\n<p>However, Ryan claims that his complaint has not been properly or adequately investigated by the commission and has brought High Court judicial review proceedings against the DPC.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>In his action, Ryan, represented by James Doherty SC and Sean O\u2019Sullivan Bl, seeks a declaration that the respondent has failed to carry out an investigation into the complaint with all due diligence within a reasonable time.<\/p>\n<p>He also seeks an order directing the DPC to proceed with the investigation of he that part of the complaint not addressed in the in the inquiry, without delay.<\/p>\n<p>He further seeks that the matter be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The action came before Mr Justice Charles Meenan today. The judge on an ex-parte basis, granted Ryan permission to bring his challenge.<\/p>\n<p>The matter was adjourned to a date in May.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/high-court-data-protection-commission-google-iab-europe-5710818-Mar2022\/","shortlink":"https:\/\/jrnl.ie\/5710818","type":"post","secondary_publications":[],"main_story_links":[{"text":"","url":""},{"text":"","url":""}],"categories":{"thejournal":{"id":"1","name":"Irish","slug":"irish"}},"publication_data":{"primary":"thejournal","all":["thejournal"],"categories":{"thejournal":[{"id":"1","name":"Irish","slug":"irish"}]}},"images":{"thumbnail":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-145x145.jpg","width":145,"height":145},"medium":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-296x201.jpg","width":296,"height":201},"large":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-630x428.jpg","width":630,"height":428},"larger":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-744x506.jpg","width":744,"height":506},"river_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-230x150.jpg","width":230,"height":150},"river_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-2300x1500.jpg","width":2300,"height":1500},"river_magazine_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-630x332.jpg","width":630,"height":332},"article_page_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-390x285.jpg","width":390,"height":285},"square_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-390x390.jpg","width":390,"height":390},"square_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-197x197.jpg","width":197,"height":197},"square_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-96x96.jpg","width":96,"height":96},"square_3":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-85x85.jpg","width":85,"height":85},"square_4":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-100x100.jpg","width":100,"height":100},"square_5":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-2000x2000.jpg","width":2000,"height":2000},"main_story_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-630x260.jpg","width":630,"height":260},"main_story_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-210x87.jpg","width":210,"height":87},"main_story_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-290x120.jpg","width":290,"height":120},"super_wide_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-950x260.jpg","width":950,"height":260},"super_wide_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-290x80.jpg","width":290,"height":80},"listings_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-150x100.jpg","width":150,"height":100},"listings_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-80x50.jpg","width":80,"height":50},"listings_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-225x150.jpg","width":225,"height":150},"listings_3":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200},"listings_4":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-304x203.jpg","width":304,"height":203},"listings_5":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-752x501.jpg","width":752,"height":501},"listings_6":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-310x207.jpg","width":310,"height":207},"offer_large_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-458x298.jpg","width":458,"height":298},"offer_medium_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-298x194.jpg","width":298,"height":194},"offer_small_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-218x140.jpg","width":218,"height":140},"hero_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7-1366x380.jpg","width":1366,"height":380},"original":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/viewoffourcourtsindublincitycentre-7.jpg","width":false,"height":false}},"is_short_post":false,"image_data":{"orientation":"landscape",

","content":"<p>FIVE YEARS AGO, <em>The Journal<\/em>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/ireland-data-centres-3656728-Oct2017\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported on government plans<\/a> to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world. Other countries would still have a stronger case for that title, but there\u2019s no doubt that the Irish market has seen massive growth.<\/p>\n<p>There are now around 70 data centres in Ireland, with tech giants such as Amazon, Facebook and Google all having storage facilities here. Host in Ireland, an industry group, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hostinireland.com\/post\/biannual-market-update-report-may-2021-now-available\" target=\"_blank\">said in a report last year<\/a> that ten new centres had become operational in the previous 12 months alone. Some \u20ac7 billion was spent on building facilities between 2010 and 2020, according to its estimates, with another \u20ac7 billion expected to be invested in the five-year period up to 2026.<\/p>\n<p>Ireland\u2019s attractions include a low corporate tax rate, a strong data protection regime, a common law system, and a relatively mild climate. Government officials insist there are huge benefits for Ireland as well, and not just in terms of jobs in construction and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/en\/debates\/debate\/select_committee_on_enterprise_trade_and_employment\/2021-06-30\/3\/\" target=\"_blank\">recently argued<\/a> that companies with Irish data facilities are much more likely to bring and keep other operations here, describing data as \u201ca really valuable commodity, like gold or diamonds\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that these facilities need a huge amount of energy \u2013 as much as a large town in some cases. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cso.ie\/en\/releasesandpublications\/ep\/p-dcmec\/datacentresmeteredelectricityconsumption2020\/keyfindings\/\" target=\"_blank\">Recent CSO data<\/a> shows that electricity consumption by data centres rose by 144% between 2015 and 2020, an increase said to be due to a combination of existing centres using more electricity and new ones being added to the grid. EirGrid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eirgridgroup.com\/site-files\/library\/EirGrid\/EirGrid-Group-All-Island-Generation-Capacity-Statement-2019-2028.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">has predicted<\/a> that data centres will account for 29% of the country\u2019s power demand by 2028, up from 11% in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Barry McMullin of DCU says a growing data centre sector will only complicate efforts to rapidly decarbonise our energy system. He questions whether new centres should be allowed at a time when total electricity demand is already surging. \u201cI\u2019m personally very sceptical that any further expansion of data centre deployment in Ireland can be justified in that context,\u201d he says.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the very least, I would argue that there should be a temporary moratorium unless and until consistency with the carbon budget programme can be clearly and reliably demonstrated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Industry figures stress that data centres are responsible for a relatively small proportion of Irish carbon emissions \u2013 about 1.85% in 2020, according to one estimate. Garry Connolly of Host in Ireland points out that more than 40% of Ireland\u2019s electricity now comes from renewable sources, meeting EU targets for renewable energy. He says wind and solar resources will be a big part of the solution to increased power demand, arguing that Ireland has the capacity to produce far more renewable electricity than what will be needed by households.<\/p>\n<p>Connolly senses traditionalist instincts in some of the opposition to data centres. \u201cOK, let\u2019s bring back De Valera, go back to the west and knit jumpers,\u201d he says in mocking exasperation.<\/p>\n<p>Policymakers can\u2019t afford to overlook the critical importance of these facilities, in his view.\n<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>\u201cData is to this industrial revolution what steam was to the first one. It\u2019s the catalyst by which everything revolves \u2013 society change, algorithms, smart cities.\u201d<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>But even industry defenders concede that there are concerns over electricity capacity constraints in areas where data centres are built. EirGrid has already indicated that no new data centre applications will be allowed in the greater Dublin area \u2013 where most data centres are clustered \u2013 until at least 2028. However, activists worry that other parts of the country will now be increasingly targeted for development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there other options?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Emanuela Ferrari of Futureproof Clare, which has been campaigning against the construction of a \u20ac1.2 billion data centre in Ennis, says the sector is far from the picture of sustainability promoted by industry advocates. The UCD researcher points out that data centres use fossil fuels not only through the national grid, but also through on-site gas and diesel generators.<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the vast amount of water required by most of these facilities, which can cause supply challenges during spells of hot weather. \u201cWe think it\u2019s reckless to allow these developments to go ahead when we\u2019re facing so many environmental problems,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>Ferrari also questions the value of seemingly limitless data for wider society. \u201cA lot of data is stored that it can be sold on for advertising or administrative purposes,\u201d she says. \u201cThe average data user could store all their information on hard disks like we did in the past. There\u2019s been a trend of pushing everything online, and that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been driven by corporations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Others see data centres as a fruitful new chapter in Ireland\u2019s long relationship with tech multinationals. Connolly stresses that few other countries have been as successful at exporting software. \u201cFloppy disks and CD-Roms have gone, and now we have centres that hold data. What people are forgetting in their hysteria to demonise the asset class is that this is just an evolution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow it would be easier to communicate that message if 40-foot containers were pulling up outside and people could see the boxes being loaded and brought down to the docks, and think, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Spotify and that\u2019s AirBnB, and there\u2019s Revolut.\u2019 Fibres cables are our port now, but there\u2019s no revolution going on here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But McMullin says any additional emissions must be avoided for the good of society. \u201cIt will take at least another decade for us to have copious renewable electricity supplies, and until then we just can\u2019t afford any extra electricity usage with extra emissions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to think hard now about prioritisation. What are the things we absolutely can\u2019t do without? What are the things that are keeping people safe and well and secure?

authorities, in France, the UK and Australia.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Van Thillo said: \u201cThis\u00a0Complaint\u00a0presents a unique opportunity for the European Commission to rectify the problems that have arisen as a direct result of its 2008 clearance of the\u00a0Google\/DoubleClick merger, by imposing effective remedies that will restore competition in\u00a0ad\u00a0tech, for the benefit of European

there\u2019s no basis for this; this is a penalisation of me.\u2019 Therefore, the employer needs to be very careful.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe employer would need to interrogate the reasons why somebody is not vaccinated,\u201d she explains.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the programme hasn\u2019t rolled out sufficiently, or it could be for a medical reason, or indeed, it could be for a political opinion\u2026 You start to get into tricky legal ground if you penalise people for that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The second issue, she says, is around data protection and the processing of \u201cspecial category\u201d data such as vaccination status.<\/p>\n<p>Killalea explains, \u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to process that data unless you can show that you have a proper legal basis for doing so.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd again, the absence of any instruction or guidance to employers to actually take vaccination status into account is immediately problematic because all you can do is say to the employee, \u2018Look, tell me if you\u2019re vaccinated.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Killalea says some employers have even asked if they can require workers to furnish their Digital Covid-19 Certificate as proof of vaccination status.<\/p>\n<p>This is problematic because, according to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dataprotection.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/uploads\/2021-06\/Processing%20COVID-19%20Vaccination%20Data%20in%20the%20context%20of%20Employment_0.pdf\"> guidance issued by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner<\/a>, workers \u201cshould not be asked to consent to the processing of vaccine data as this consent is not likely to be freely given\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Even redeploying unvaccinated workers within a business, as the Government\u2019s guidance suggests, could be risky, Killalea says, because workers could claim they\u2019re being penalised or treated differently.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_3\"]<\/p>\n<p>With all of this in the foreground, there is a \u201cstrong desire\u201d among employers for fresh public health guidance that clarifies whether vaccination status \u201cis actually a key prevention and control measure for the spread of Covid-19\u2033, Killalea says.<\/p>\n<p>She adds, \u201cFor example, the Work Safely Protocol talks about the importance of social distancing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody knows to keep two metres distance. No one questions this. If someone comes within two metres of us you can say, \u2018Please don\u2019t because the public health guidance has told us there is increased risk if you do.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo wouldn\u2019t it

Even Luxembourg and the Netherlands, typically two of Ireland\u2019s biggest allies in Europe when it comes to defending our competitive tax environment, have given the nod to the deal.<\/p>\n<p>Finance minister Paschal Donohoe is keen to get across the point that the broad agreement reached yesterday is not final.<\/p>\n<p>A plan for the implementation of the framework won\u2019t come into focus until October and in the meantime, Donohoe said, Ireland will continue to make the case for keeping its 12.5% rate.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s not alone in this. Two other low-tax European countries \u2014 Hungary and Estonia \u2014 are also holding out.<\/p>\n<p>Donohoe, for his part, said that Ireland still \u201cbroadly supports\u201d the deal, just not the 15% rate.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, tax havens like Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other nations like Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Kenya have also rejected the agreement for the time being.<\/p>\n<p>Peru abstained as it\u2019s currently without a government following a recent election, the results of which are yet to be finalised.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Poster boy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The reasons for Ireland\u2019s intransigence on the issue of a global minimum rate are obvious.<\/p>\n<p>Our model of development has largely hinged on our ability to lure multinational companies through our competitive, low business tax rate environment.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a model for which the country has become a poster boy since the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>Successive Irish governments slashed the business tax rate every year between 1994 and 1999 before introducing the world-famous 12.5% version between 1999 and 2003, which remains in place.<\/p>\n<p>The result: Ireland has managed to convince some of the biggest companies in the world to headquarter here.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>Corporation tax is now Ireland\u2019s third-largest source of tax revenue, behind income tax and VAT, worth \u20ac11.8 billion to the State in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>One in every five euros the Irish exchequer takes in is from corporate taxes.<\/p>\n<p>So, the argument goes, in a situation where the global playing field is level and Ireland is forced to raise its tax rate to 15%, the economy loses some of its competitive advantages.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn calculating their tax liabilities,\u201d the Central Bank said this week, multinationals would no longer be able to blend taxes paid in high-tax jurisdictions with taxes paid in low-tax countries.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis would reduce the relative attractiveness of the Irish system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although the Department of Finance has estimated that these changes could cost the exchequer up to \u20ac2 billion each year in the long run, the Central Bank says there is considerable uncertainty about how it will all shake out.<\/p>\n<p>In one scenario, it said, the changes could reduce the overall volume of profits being booked in Ireland by multinationals and thus reduce the State\u2019s tax take but without impacting multinational activity in Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>In a more negative scenario, the changes could scare off investors altogether.<\/p>\n<p>This would have \u201cmore serious implications for the public finances since it would not only reduce corporation tax revenue but also potentially lead to lower revenue from other sources such as VAT and income tax\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>But the outlook is far from certain and we\u2019ll have to see the details of the final deal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Two pillars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From an international perspective, the benefits of the deal are just as obvious as the threat it seems to pose to Irish public finances.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For the last 30 years or so, the world\u2019s biggest corporations have cut labour costs by offshoring production to emerging markets like China and India where wages are cheaper.<\/p>\n<p>Simultaneously, through tax competition and sweetheart arrangements with national governments, they have been empowered to shop around for the lowest rates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe trouble is, with Ireland running a 12.5% rate and the likes of the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands not taxing corporate profits at all,\u201d explained Bloomberg columnist David Fickling in April, \u201cit\u2019s a race to the bottom that rich-country governments can only win by either drastically cutting spending or by shifting more and more of the fiscal burden onto the shoulders of middle-and working-class voters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why the United States is leading the charge behind the OECD proposals.<\/p>\n<p>A related issue is profit shifting.<\/p>\n<p>This is when a company like Apple, for example, books its sales revenues in a home base country like Ireland, far away from where most of its users are and where its sales are generated.<\/p>\n<p>Engaging in this (perfectly legal) practice means that just three companies \u2014 Microsoft, Google and Facebook \u2014 could be depriving the Global South of a whopping $2.8 billion each year, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/actionaid.org\/news\/2020\/28bn-tax-gap-exposed-actionaid-research-reveals-tip-iceberg-big-techs-big-tax-bill-global#_ftn3\">ActionAid International<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>This \u2018tax gap\u2019 is \u201cbased on the share of the three tech giants\u2019 global profits, relative to their number of users and adjusted for countries\u2019 GDP per capita\u201d, the NGO explained at the time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIndia, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria and Bangladesh are the markets studied with the highest \u2018tax gaps\u2019 from these three companies,\u201d according to ActionAid\u2019s estimates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe total \u2018tax gap\u2019 for the 20 countries contained in the research is $2.8bn, equivalent to 729,010 nurses, 770,649 midwives or 879,899 primary school teachers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Two pillars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The OECD has been conducting discussions around remedies to both of these two issues \u2014 lumped together under the heading of \u2018base erosion and profit shifting,\u2019 or BEPS for short \u2014 for the last number of years.<\/p>\n<p>There are two pillars to the BEPS agreement.<\/p>\n<p>One is the harmonised minimum tax rate.<\/p>\n<p>The other pillar, squarely aimed at tackling profit shifting, is a little more complex.<\/p>\n<p>To oversimplify it, this part of the agreement \u2014 which Ireland has signed up to \u2014 will allow countries and jurisdictions to tax the biggest companies in the world even if they don\u2019t have a physical presence in that country.<\/p>\n<p>Under this pillar, India just for example, will have the right to tax nearly any company with a global annual turnover of \u20ac20 billion and pre-tax profit margins of 10% or more if the company generates at least \u20ac1 million in sales from Indian customers.<\/p>\n<p>That \u20ac20 billion threshold falls to \u20ac10 billion after seven years and the OECD believes it could generate an extra \u20ac84.5 billion in tax revenues annually.<\/p>\n<p>The global minimum 15% rate, meanwhile, could force companies to pay an extra \u20ac125 billion in taxes annually, according to OECD estimates.<\/p>\n<p>There are caveats, of course.<\/p>\n<p>Companies in extractive industries like oil, gas and logging have been excluded from the taxing rights rules, partially to protect the interests of resource-exporting countries in Africa and elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>In a big diplomatic win for the City of London and UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/tax\/beps\/oecd-g20-inclusive-framework-members-joining-statement-on-two-pillar-solution-to-address-tax-challenges-arising-from-digitalisation-july-2021.pdf\">the 130 nations<\/a> also agreed to exempt regulated financial firms from the new rules.<\/p>\n<p>These exemptions were not enough to sway Ireland or the eight other countries that are holding out.<\/p>\n<p>But whatever the next four months bring with them, the Doomsday Clock seems to be inexorably ticking towards midnight for Ireland\u2019s 12.5% rate.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/global-tax-reform-ireland-5483510-Jul2021\/","shortlink":"https:\/\/jrnl.ie\/5483510","type":"post","secondary_publications":[],"main_story_links":[{"text":"","url":""},{"text":"","url":""}],"categories":{"thejournal":{"id":"30","name":"Business","slug":"business"}},"publication_data":{"primary":"thejournal","all":["thejournal"],"categories":{"thejournal":[{"id":"1","name":"Irish","slug":"irish"},{"id":"2","name":"International","slug":"international"},{"id":"30","name":"Business","slug":"business"}]}},"images":{"thumbnail":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-145x145.jpg","width":145,"height":145},"medium":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-296x197.jpg","width":296,"height":197},"large":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-630x419.jpg","width":630,"height":419},"larger":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-744x495.jpg","width":744,"height":495},"river_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-230x150.jpg","width":230,"height":150},"river_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-2300x1500.jpg","width":2300,"height":1500},"river_magazine_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-630x332.jpg","width":630,"height":332},"article_page_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-390x285.jpg","width":390,"height":285},"square_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-390x390.jpg","width":390,"height":390},"square_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-197x197.jpg","width":197,"height":197},"square_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-96x96.jpg","width":96,"height":96},"square_3":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-85x85.jpg","width":85,"height":85},"square_4":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-100x100.jpg","width":100,"height":100},"square_5":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-2000x2000.jpg","width":2000,"height":2000},"main_story_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-630x260.jpg","width":630,"height":260},"main_story_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-210x87.jpg","width":210,"height":87},"main_story_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-290x120.jpg","width":290,"height":120},"super_wide_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-950x260.jpg","width":950,"height":260},"super_wide_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-290x80.jpg","width":290,"height":80},"listings_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-150x100.jpg","width":150,"height":100},"listings_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-80x50.jpg","width":80,"height":50},"listings_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-225x150.jpg","width":225,"height":150},"listings_3":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200},"listings_4":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-304x203.jpg","width":304,"height":203},"listings_5":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-752x501.jpg","width":752,"height":501},"listings_6":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-310x207.jpg","width":310,"height":207},"offer_large_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-458x298.jpg","width":458,"height":298},"offer_medium_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-298x194.jpg","width":298,"height":194},"offer_small_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-218x140.jpg","width":218,"height":140},"hero_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036-1366x380.jpg","width":1366,"height":380},"original":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2021\/07\/shutterstock_1943215036.jpg","width":false,"height":false}},"is_short_post":false,"image_data":{"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Shutterstock\/Claire
