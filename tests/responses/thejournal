The fighting stopped almost as suddenly as it started. Unlike the current Ukraine war, Russian forces could claim, at least to some extent, that they were responding to a Georgian attack.<\/p>\n<p>After unwisely allowing themselves to be provoked, on 7 August that year, Georgian forces crossed into Russian held territory with heavy weapons, egged on by their then pro-western leader Mikheil Saakashvili. What followed was a swift Russian counter-attack which turned into a rout of the Georgians, quite unlike the fierce and brave resistance Ukraine\u2019s defenders are showing.<\/p>\n<p>Russian forces were poised near Tbilisi ready to lay siege. Fearing the inevitable bloodbath, on 12 August, French President Nicolas Sarkozy managed to secure a ceasefire after a phone call with Putin, and the basic contours of a peace deal were ironed out over the next few days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Georgia conclusion<br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The gist of this was that Russian forces agreed to return to their initial positions, prisoners were exchanged and Georgia agreed that they would renounce the use of force to resolve the status of Russian backed secessionist areas in Georgia.\n<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>In reality, these Russian enclaves became even more militarised with a Russian Army presence. Georgia has lost them for the foreseeable future.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, Putin did not formally demand that Georgia remove its application to join NATO or the EU as part of the ceasefire. In practice, however, Georgia\u2019s application for full membership of both entities was put on \u2018ice\u2019 by western states, especially as it was perceived that Saakashvili had acted so rashly.<\/p>\n<p>However, today Georgia is clearly a western-oriented country and has a strong partnership association with NATO, including joint military training, just as Ukraine has. There is also an association agreement with the EU and more liberal visa rules. It seems very unlikely that the Ukraine war will end with this outcome. Macron has spoken with Putin several times and has little to show for it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Putin\u2019s folly in Ukraine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In contrast to the Georgian war, the invasion of Ukraine is a more foolish and open-ended military operation, that has gone horribly wrong for Putin. No quick victory or rout is obvious. Putin, therefore, needs a tangible military victory before he can agree to any ceasefire, and he may also have minimal geographic objectives, notably the port of Odessa or seizing as much of the coast as he can, which would allow him to economically strangle Ukraine.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Some analysts believe that Putin has therefore resigned himself to a slow bloody war of attrition that could go on for months.\u00a0The 1999-2000 Russian siege of Grozny lasted four months while the Russian backed siege of Aleppo extended from mid-summer to December 2016. Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa may be battlegrounds for weeks if not months more.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, why would Putin settle for a deal that merely brings him back to the position he had before the invasion \u2013 annexation of the Crimea and \u2018controlling\u2019 the puppet enclaves of the Donbas? There is no way he will be as \u2018generous\u2019 as he was with Georgia in 2008.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>However, if the Ukrainians manage to hold on militarily, or possibly with greater western support if they inflict significant reversals on Putin\u2019s forces, then whoever leads Russia by the autumn may be simply forced to accept a Georgia style ceasefire which marks a return to something like the status quo before the invasion.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>This is one reason why military aid for Ukraine is so important. Negotiation with Putin from a position of military weakness or strength will have a direct relationship upon what sort of Ukraine emerges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finlandisation as the endgame?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finland ended up signing treaties with Stalin in 1947 and 1948 after fighting two wars against the Soviet Union. The first \u201cwinter war\u201d, between November 1939 to March 1940, occurred when Stalin invaded Finland, just like how Putin has invaded Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>In an echo of today, the Finns fought heroically and the Red Army disastrously, but in the end, they were forced to sue for peace. This war was continued when Nazi Germany invaded Russia in 1941. By 1944 the Finns realised they were on the losing side of World War II and they negotiated a separate armistice.<\/p>\n<p>This political and psychological context here is quite different from Ukraine today.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Finland was on the losing side of a much wider war, not just once but twice. Notwithstanding this, Stalin was prepared to be relatively generous probably because he was preoccupied with crushing freedom in Poland, East Germany and the rest of what became the Warsaw Pact.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So Finland was not re-annexed (unlike the Baltic states) nor were Finnish Communists empowered to simply take over. Finland was allowed to keep her democratic institutions and free and fair elections. Finland was also allowed to continue to trade with the west, although this was hedged.<\/p>\n<p>Finland only became a full member of the European Free Trade Area in 1986, and joining the EEC was out of the question. Moreover, Finland had to pay enormous war reparations, turning a sector of the Finnish economy into serving the Russians. They also had to accept a large Russian military base on their territory, which was only removed in 1956.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Finland was therefore obliged to be a neutral state, not by choice, but through a mixture of formal written guarantees but also many informal \u2018understandings\u2019 between Russian leaders and a handful of senior Finnish politicians.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>While Finland could remain a free western-oriented country they had to do nothing as regards military and foreign policy that might threaten the USSR, or even displease it. That meant often returning Russian dissidents back to the KGB. It also meant not condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or the systematic human rights violations.<\/p>\n<p>By the late 1950s and early 1960s, premier of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev had perfected the art of not so subtly interfering in Finnish politics to signal his displeasure at the make-up of Finnish coalition governments: some Finnish parties had to informally agree to not join a government regardless of their votes, lest it offend the Russians. The Soviet Politburo repeatedly signalled that they expected the key personality of Urho Kekkonen to remain President of Finland as long as possible, as he was \u2018their man\u2019 whom they could do business with. He dominated Finnish politics for almost two decades.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>After 1991 Finland dumped their servile relationship with Russia and while remaining non-aligned they have joined the EU and have become very close to NATO without actually joining it, yet.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>All Finns understood these horrible compromises as necessary given their history and as part of a wider Cold War. People today who advocate historic Finnish style neutrality as a quick fix for the Ukraine war would do well to understand that something as subtle or consensual is very unlikely to work today.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>For a start, Putin will want guarantees that he can control domestic Ukrainian politics with a lot more certainty. If free and fair Ukrainian elections are permitted, these will likely produce independent-minded governments that will sooner or later, simply not play along.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If Ukraine is allowed to keep its trade and association agreements with the EU this will further undercut Putin\u2019s attempt to control the country.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ukraine as a vassal state<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So while what Putin wants might be called \u2018Finlandisation\u2019 to make it sound more acceptable to western audiences, it probably will be much more invidious, and closer to making Ukraine a vassal state like Belarus.<\/p>\n<p>In this scenario, it is possible that NATO membership may be taken off the table by the Ukrainians themselves to placate Russian demands. In fact, many NATO states would be relieved with that outcome and they could place pressure on the Ukrainians to accept such a condition.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, NATO has actually adopted a policy of not giving Ukraine full membership and instead has offered them and other states a vaguer association and cooperation template. The possible future membership of NATO by Ukraine is thus quite a bit of a red herring dangled by Putin\u2019s western apologists, experts and academics who should know better.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Moreover, the neutrality of Ukraine will not solve the political problems that Putin now has; Ukrainians want to be a free and democratic pro-western state with minimal influence from what is revealed to be a despotic Russian regime. They all hate Putin and many hate Russia. They will resist whatever way they can.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Putin can\u2019t afford to give them a genuine Finland style deal and the Ukrainians do not psychologically seem near to accepting the defeat that would require them to accept it.<\/p>\n<p>If their cities fall, a large scale insurgency will continue and this is a serious military threat for the Russians who cannot control a country the size of Ukraine. In contrast to the Finns in 1946, Ukrainians don\u2019t accept they are beaten yet, and they know they are not on the wrong side of history.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stumbling towards a partition style conflict-like Kashmir?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One other way the Ukraine war may end is with a de facto military partition that produces two distinct Ukraines: a western, democratic one and an eastern entity, Russian backed and controlled.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>This has similarities with how the tragic case of Kashmir played out after 1947. Pakistan retains control of a large segment and India a much larger portion of the territory (China is also involved but we can ignore this detail). Both India and Pakistan have never agreed an official demarcation line and the border is a UN established line of control after the 1965 war.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>A large Muslim population inside Indian Kashmir refuses to accept Indian sovereignty and an insurgency, supported by Pakistan, continues to unfold seemingly without end. Indians and Kashmiris are trapped in a vicious and brutal guerrilla war that neither side can apparently win but both cannot afford to lose.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>This violence and rivalry continue with the shadow of Indian and Pakistan nuclear weapons threatening each other and the possibility at any time that a much bigger conventional war over Kashmir could break out between the two.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If this is Ukraine\u2019s future, it suggests that conflict, fighting and instability will be endemic there for many years and possibly decades to come. This violence would forge long-lasting patterns of animosity between Europe and the Russian Federation.<\/p>\n<p>There would be no going back to the relationship before February 2022. Indeed for the next decades, Russia may never return to the wider western economy as anything other than an increasingly marginal supplier of energy commodities which over the long term will be reduced in preference for other suppliers and sources of energy.<\/p>\n<p>A Cold War every bit as intense and heavily armed is as conceivable as the one that prevailed between 1948 and 1990.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, NATO may well call Putin\u2019s bluff on nuclear threats as Pakistan has repeatedly been able to do in Kashmir, by supporting with arms a large and long-term insurgency inside Ukraine.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Or NATO and the EU may offer full membership to the \u2018rump\u2019 western Ukraine and provide them with the military means to counter balance the Russian backed occupied zone. This would look something like the stand-off between South and North Korea and could be as long-lasting.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_3\"]<\/p>\n<p>Such an outcome might actually be preferable for many Ukrainians compared to the much touted Finlandisation, which is another reason why that solution may not work.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it would scarcely be sensible for Putin to agree to such a partition. A rump western Ukraine would forever be a thorn in the side of the Russian occupied or annexed part, in the same way, that rivalry between East and West Germany was intense and at times pathological. It was the cornerstone of the Cold War. Equally, the possibility for insurgency and revanchist wars following the Kashmir playbook would be entirely foreseeable, meaning that it would be unlikely to be perceived as a stable outcome for Russia.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>However, it may be what the military situation on the ground produces: a bloody stalemate whereby Russia can seize some cities in the east and south of Ukraine, but only after making them rubble, yet the Russian military may not be able to seize or hold the entire country. A rump \u2018free\u2019 Western Ukraine would thus emerge by military default and a Kashmir type conflict would be set in stone.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>None of these analogies is a perfect model to understand where the Ukraine conflict may end up. It is quite possible that what will emerge is some mixture of all three scenarios with entirely novel elements. However, taken together they do reveal some issues which will be central whenever the fighting abates, either because of stalemate, exhaustion, or defeat by one or both parties.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, the analyses here suggests that the fighting is more likely to continue and be long-lasting rather than simply ending within days and weeks. Most of the scenarios involve a semi-autonomous and possibly independent Ukraine continuing to exist, although Finlandisation may be a code word for actually a much tougher imposed vassalage.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>However, a genuinely autonomous but possibly partitioned Ukrainian state could easily continue to associate with NATO and the EU, and possibly even join.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Putin may be delusional enough to think his military can crush all opposition and simply impose a solution but this seems unlikely, at least for now. Indeed the longer he opts for a war of attrition the more likely he is to end up with a Kashmir type partition and insurgency. And if tries to impose a Finland style neutralisation his dilemma is this would literally leave Ukraine free of his influence and the Ukrainians are unlikely to play along as the Finns did.<\/p>\n<p>To settle for a return to the status quo, Georgia style, would be the best humanitarian outcome and the best for Ukraine right now, but for both those reasons, Putin is unlikely to agree to it.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Worryingly for the Ukrainians, given the seeming failure of Polish attempts to transfer fighter jets or the recent comments by the German chancellor that there is no military solution, Putin may be correct in assuming that western countries will not intervene with enough military support to make any Ukrainian military resistance credible enough to force him into negotiations.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Yet one of the ironies of choosing the path of war is that leaders who do so are at the mercy of whatever victories their generals can bring them but also whatever the opposition is willing to suffer.<\/p>\n<p>For Ukrainians, this has been already too much but one of the lessons of modern conflicts has been the longevity and intractability of wars. There will then be no neat, easy or clear-cut endgame. The best we might hope for is that all the parties to the conflict stumble around the least worst options.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dr Brendan Flynn is head of discipline for Politics and an assistant professor\/lecturer at the School of Political Science and Sociology, NUI Galway.

economists at the moment with more bad news\u00a0arriving on the cost-of-living front seemingly every day.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>First, it was household energy bills. But as ripples from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine begin to make their way out into the global economy, it\u2019s become clear that from food to construction materials, price inflation is touching everything \u2014 and it\u2019s likely to be here for longer than we previously thought.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Outright shortages of goods and inputs are also becoming a distinct possibility as the war takes its toll on fertiliser supplies, metals and grains. Irish farmers are being urged (and monetary incentivised) by the Government to grow more tillage crops amid concern about scarcities.<\/p>\n<p>If all this economic anxiety is enough to drive you to drink, there\u2019s bad news there too. The price of a pint could climb higher due to the loss of Ukrainian and Russian grain to global markets.<\/p>\n<p>As a direct result of higher prices coupled with the impact on international trade, economists now believe that the war and related inflation could weigh heavily on Irish, European and global economic growth this year.<\/p>\n<p>The dreaded \u2018r\u2019 word is returning to the political lexicon after a couple of years with Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin saying recently that a recession can\u2019t be ruled out.<\/p>\n<p>How did we get here and what\u2019s the outlook for the rest of the year?<\/p>\n<p><b>Acceptable in the \u201980s.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Most Irish people born after the 1970s and 1980s have had little or no experience of inflation.<\/p>\n<p>On more than one occasion between 1978 and 1981, the annual rate of price increases topped an eye-watering 20%.<\/p>\n<p>Back then, a series of oil supply shocks throughout the 1970s due to the geopolitical fallout (stop me if this sounds vaguely familiar) from conflicts in the Middle East sent the price of crude and, consequently, petrol and diesel through the roof. Ireland, like most countries at the time, suffered the consequences \u2014 higher home heating and car fuel prices.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>But more or less,\u00a0that\u2019s where the similarities between then and now end.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The main culprit in the late 1970s \u2014 as former head of macroeconomics at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/business\/economy\/john-fitzgerald-low-rate-of-inflation-brings-its-own-problems-1.3063426\">Professor John Fitzgerald, has explained previously<\/a> \u2014 was the relationship between the Irish punt and the British pound sterling.<\/p>\n<p>The value of Ireland\u2019s currency was, at the time, fixed to that of Britain\u2019s on a one-to-one basis. Without going into too much detail, it meant that Irish prices were very sensitive to what was happening in Britain where inflation averaged out at a very high 14% across the whole of the 1970s.<\/p>\n<p>That one-to-one relationship between punt and pound ended in 1978 when Ireland joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Still, inflation hit a bleak 23% in 1981 due to lingering global inflationary pressures, which were magnified by increased government spending at a time when the economy wasn\u2019t in a position to absorb it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very different to the context now,\u201d explains Conor O\u2019Toole, Associate Research Professor with the ESRI and co-author of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/inflation-growth-forecasts-5717014-Mar2022\/\" target=\"_blank\">the think-tank\u2019s latest Quarterly Economic Commentary<\/a>, published this week.<\/p>\n<p>In its latest set of forecasts, the ESRI has upwardly revised its inflation forecasts from 4% to 6.7% this year. That\u2019s well above 2% targeted by the European Central Bank, which is in charge of maintaining price stability across the Eurozone.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we have at present is pretty much all being driven by international factors,\u201d O\u2019Toole tells\u00a0<em>The Journal<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Unprecedented increases\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Those international factors were already driving up Irish prices before Russia\u2019s invasion. of Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>Irish consumer prices were on average 5% higher in January 2022 than a year previous.<\/p>\n<p>Rebounding consumer demand coupled with global supply chain pressures \u2014 which made goods and raw materials more difficult to get into the country, inflating their prices \u2014 were partly responsible.<\/p>\n<p>But an energy crisis that swept across Europe in the back half of 2021 also conspired to push up the wholesale price of natural gas throughout last year.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/explainer-energy-prices-russia-5698511-Mar2022\/\"><em>Read: How reliant is Ireland on Russian energy \u2013 and why are gas and oil prices rising?<\/em><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/inflation-vimes-boots-index-5671363-Feb2022\/\"><em>Read: Why is everything more expensive?<\/em><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these factors have now been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and the various tranches of Western sanctions that have been placed on the Russian economy.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/iframe\/?key=rlW7rNO0xCcus&amp;html=PGJsb2NrcXVvdGUgY2xhc3M9InR3aXR0ZXItdHdlZXQiPjxwIGxhbmc9ImVuIiBkaXI9Imx0ciI%252BV2FyIGluIFVrcmFpbmUgd2lsbCBwdXNoIHVwIGZvb2QgYW5kIGVuZXJneSBwcmljZXMgYWNyb3NzIEV1cm9wZTxicj7igKIgUGVyc29uYWwgc2F2aW5ncyBhcmUgbm90IGVub3VnaCB0byBhYnNvcmIgaW5jb21lIHNxdWVlemUsIGVzcGVjaWFsbHkgaW4gc291dGhlcm4gRXVyb3BlICjwn4e18J%252BHufCfh6rwn4e48J%252BHrvCfh7nwn4es8J%252BHtyk8YnI%252B4oCiIFBvb3JlciBob3VzZWhvbGRzIHRvIGJlIGhpdCBoYXJkZXN0LCBhcyB0aGV5IHNwZW5kIGhpZ2hlciBwcm9wb3J0aW9uIG9mIGluY29tZSBvbiBmb29kL2VuZXJneSA8YSBocmVmPSJodHRwczovL3QuY28veVdkd0F6NFduYiI%252BcGljLnR3aXR0ZXIuY29tL3lXZHdBejRXbmI8L2E%252BPC9wPiZtZGFzaDsgQWdhdGhlIERlbWFyYWlzIChAQWdhdGhlRGVtYXJhaXMpIDxhIGhyZWY9Imh0dHBzOi8vdHdpdHRlci5jb20vQWdhdGhlRGVtYXJhaXMvc3RhdHVzLzE1MDYyOTc2ODg3MjMyNzE2ODk%252FcmVmX3NyYz10d3NyYyU1RXRmdyI%252BTWFyY2ggMjIsIDIwMjI8L2E%252BPC9ibG9ja3F1b3RlPiA8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF0Zm9ybS50d2l0dGVyLmNvbS93aWRnZXRzLmpzIiBjaGFyc2V0PSJ1dGYtOCI%252BPC9zY3JpcHQ%252B\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn terms of further sanctions,\u201d the ESRI said this week, \u201cif Western authorities decide, for example, to reduce European consumption of Russian gas, this would almost inevitably lead to higher energy bills over the short to medium-term.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Alarm bells are being rung across the economy at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Ireland is \u201cacutely vulnerable\u201d to global energy shocks, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council warned this week.

The ten-point drop in the\u00a0bank\u2019s confidence index represents the 11th largest monthly decline in the survey\u2019s history.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s no shock,\u00a0KBC\u00a0Bank\u2019s Chief Economist Austin Hughes said, given the \u201ctorrent of bad news on living costs\u201d in recent weeks. \u201cConsumers were notably more pessimistic in relation to the prospects for their household finances in the year ahead,\u201d Hughes added, \u201cwith negative responses outnumbering positives by over 4 to 1 in March compared to just under 2 to 1 in February\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The combined impact of higher prices and greater uncertainty in global trade is likely to weaken growth this year compared to previous forecasts, the ESRI said this week.<\/p>\n<p>Although Irish GDP is still expected to grow robustly by 7% in 2022, this represents a downgrade from the ESRI\u2019s last set of projections before last Christmas, when it had pencilled in growth of 6.2% this year.<\/p>\n<p>Modified Domestic Demand \u2014\u00a0a measure of domestic economic activity that strips out the distorting impact of multinationals and the aircraft leasing sector \u2014 is also forecast to grow by 5%, down sharply from a previous forecast of 7.1%.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Investment and trade are also expected to grow but at a weaker rate than expected as businesses make difficult choices against the backdrop of rising prices.<\/p>\n<p>However, the outlook is still relatively positively, the ESRI\u2019s O\u2019Toole said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think if inflation follows the line in terms of our forecasts and if the labour market follows that as well, it\u2019s likely we will still get household consumption growth this year,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut there\u2019s huge headwinds really on the economy, and the risks are on the downside,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that can\u2019t really be understated at this stage.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<span

The Canadian escaped unhurt.<\/p>\n<p>The crash came towards the end of a Q2 session which in a major shock did not feature Hamilton who was knocked out of the first qualifying run for the first time since 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Mercedes\u2019 seven-time world champion has 103 poles to his name, but in a major upset will start Sunday\u2019s race from towards the rear of the grid.<\/p>\n<p>As Q1 drew to a close Hamilton was languishing in 16th with only the top 15 progressing, but failed to make it out of the drop zone with his last flying lap.<\/p>\n<p>He was knocked out of Q1 in Brazil five years ago after a crash but the last time he failed to progress to Q2 on pace alone was at the British Grand Prix in 2009.<\/p>\n<p>Hamilton had struggled throughout practice in his \u2018bouncing\u2019 new Mercedes, but new team-mate George Russell appeared to overcome that challenge as he progressed with the fourth-best time.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI struggled with the balance of the car, not where I want to be,\u201d Hamilton told Sky Sports.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately just went the wrong way with the set up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc led the times in to Q2 as he maintained his early season form after winning in Bahrain last weekend and again topped the time sheets after Q2 resumed to head in to Q3 as favourite to claim pole.<\/p>\n<p>The Grand Prix weekend went ahead but only after lengthy talks overnight about racing in the aftermath of Friday\u2019s missile strike by Yemen\u2019s Huthi rebels on the nearby Aramco fuel plant, which ignited a blaze with black smoke billowing across the street circuit.<\/p>\n<p>Team principals, race organisers, Formula One and the ruling body, the FIA, had said they had reached a unanimous agreement for the show to go on, in less than an hour, but it took much longer to convince the drivers.<\/p>\n<p>After around three and a half hours of further talks, they agreed to race.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on their behalf, the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association (GPDA) said \u201cnatural human concerns\u201d had caused many to have doubts about taking part.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/www.the42.ie\/mick-schumacher-crash-5722256-Mar2022\/","shortlink":"https:\/\/the42.ie\/5722256","type":"post","secondary_publications":["thejournal"],"main_story_links":[{"text":"","url":""},{"text":"","url":""}],"categories":{"thescore":{"id":"17","name":"Other

Fitzgibbon struck the key goal for the Rebels. ","content":"<h3>Cork 1-27<br>\nKilkenny 2-20<\/h3>\n<p><em>John Coleman reports from Pairc Ui Chaoimh<\/em><\/p>\n<p>ULTIMATELY IT WAS a devastating 1-3 blitz five minutes from time that propelled Cork into the final of the Allianz NHL final next weekend against either Waterford of Wexford.<\/p>\n<p>The Rebels trailed by 2-18 to 0-23 in P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh prior to the game winning salvo and had been generally on the backfoot throughout as a result of two first half goals from Kilkenny\u2019s Martin Keoghan.<\/p>\n<p>Cork were a different animal in the second half and though they huffed and puffed, they couldn\u2019t find a way to knock Kilkenny down until Darragh Fitzgibbon struck for a goal following good work from substitutes Conor Cahalane and Jack O\u2019Connor. As ever, Eoin Murphy got a touch, but there was enough on the shot to get the job done.<\/p>\n<p>Two points from Conor Lehane, who was outstanding throughout, then sandwiched another score from Fitzgibbon to put the game to rest. Padraig Walsh and Alan Murphy points gave the Cats a glimmer of hope but Lehane\u2019s sixth point of the second half ended a memorable night on Leeside in front of 16,000 fans.<\/p>\n<p>Eoin Cody and Billy Ryan caused Cork endless problems in the opening half as they shot 0-7 between them as the Rebels failed to deal with Kilkenny\u2019s greater desire and tactical acumen, with the positioning of Cillian Buckley and P\u00e1draig Walsh in particular giving them headaches.<\/p>\n<p>Martin Keoghan, like all good full forwards, was in the right place at the right time to notch his first goal in the second minute and his side led by 1-4 to 0-1 after seven.<\/p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>Slowly, Cork began to establish a foothold in the game through the free taking of Patrick Horgan, the class of Alan Connolly and defensive qualities of Ciar\u00e1n Joyce. They outscored Kilkenny by 0-8 to 0-2 across the next sixteen minutes with Horgan, Joyce and Connolly responsible for all of them to level the sides for the second time.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>Kilkenny\u2019s wiliness soon had them back on the front foot with a second goal from Keoghan, who finished smartly after rounding D\u00e1ire O\u2019Leary, putting the Noresiders back in control.<\/p>\n<p>It was even from there to the break with Horgan tapping over two more frees and Shane Barrett getting his first score but points from P\u00e1draig Walsh, Ryan and Murphy left the Cats leading by 2-12 to 0-14 at the break.<\/p>\n<p>Cork, however, were transformed on the resumption and successive points from Shane Kingston, Lehane, Connolly and substitute Timmy O\u2019Mahony levelled the game for the third time.<\/p>\n<p>They couldn\u2019t get ahead though, as and scores from Cody and Murphy soon had Kilkenny back in the driving seat. There was a feeling that Kilkenny were creaking, however, with Ciaran Joyce colossal at the back for Cork but their final ball was lacking.<\/p>\n<p>Two scores from Patrick Horgan, his last contribution of the game, had Cork level again before a Lehane free gave them the lead for the first time.

radio documentary features tributes to Laura from former Health Minister Simon Harris and Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin.","content":"<p>A NEW RADIO documentary celebrating the life and work of HPV vaccine campaigner Laura Brennan has been released to mark three years since her death.<\/p>\n<p>Laura was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 24. After her diagnosis, she became involved in the campaign to raise awareness of the HPV vaccine to try to save lives.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Laura Brennan, The Voice\u2019 tells the story of Laura\u2019s life from growing up in Ennis in Co Clare to her work advocating for the HPV vaccine, until her death in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The documentary features testimonies from those who knew Laura best: her parents Larry and Bernie, her brothers Colin, Fergal and Kevin, and her friends, as well as the President of Royal College of Physicians Mary Horgan and former health minister Simon Harris.<\/p>\n<p>Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin also recorded a tribute to Laura for the documentary, saying that her \u201ccourageous advocacy in highlighting the fight against cervical cancer, without question, saved the lives of many women\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The documentary was written, produced and directed by Clare FM\u2019s Programme Director Padraic Flaherty. Speaking to <em>The Journal<\/em>, Flaherty said it was an honour to put the tribute together.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d have known of Larry, her father, who\u2019s a very good author. He and Bernie and, when Laura was alive, all had a great relationship with the station. She\u2019s always remained in my thoughts and I said, do you know what, her anniversary will be coming up on Sunday, so I set about doing this late last year,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThankfully, I gave my idea to Larry and Bernie, and they said yeah, anything that they could do to help out that they will be on hand at the end of the phone, which was a great help, because when you\u2019re talking about a young girl that lost her life so tragically, for her family to be able to talk so openly about that, in itself, is a great gift to get.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Flaherty began working on the documentary late last year. When it came to getting interviews for the documentary, he said that those who knew Laura were more than willing to pay tribute to her.\n<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>She touched everyone in a way, and family and friends were there straightaway with the hands up, but equally, when I got on to the Taoiseach\u2019s office and to Simon Harris\u2019s office to say: \u2018Look, I\u2019m doing this documentary, would the ministers be interested in taking part?\u2019 And it\u2019s a great endorsement of what Laura did when they turned around and said: \u2018Absolutely, we want to be involved, how can we help?\u2019<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cTo get that from the Taoiseach and from the former Minister for Health, it\u2019s super. Mary Horgan, she was brilliant. She had such affection for Laura. And when I did the interview with Mary, she was still up to her neck in Covid issues and the same for Taoiseach as well. So they both took time out and they were both very, very happy to lend their voice to it,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>After learning in September 2017 that her cancer was terminal, Laura began advocating publicly in favour of the HPV vaccine. In the documentary, Horgan outlines Laura\u2019s importance to the HPV vaccine campaign.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was incredibly important. This was at a time when the HPV vaccine uptake dipped quite considerably because of a lot of ill informed people putting misinformation out on social media,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a HPV Alliance and that included patient advocates so it resulted in a huge upswing from uptake of vaccine, which was only about 50% to it going right up to approximately 80% of the time, and a huge amount of that was to Laura, her personal story.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Flaherty said it was important for him to highlight the work that Laura did for the vaccine campaign.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith everything going on with Covid for the last few years, getting vaccinated, which was obviously a priority for the country, the HPV vaccination somewhat got lost in conversation. Especially in this county, we\u2019re always aware of the levels that it went to, which was 90% in Clare and that was all down to Laura,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Despite knowing the family, Flaherty said he learned while making the documentary just how much Laura\u2019s death affected them, and how they got through it.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>For them to be able to deal with it, and to kind of get an understanding firsthand of what they had to go through for those few days before she passed away and when she passed away. You know, I knew it was heartbreaking, it\u2019s a heartbreaking, heart wrenching story, but to hear it firsthand from Larry and Bernie and the lads. The strength of that family, certainly, would give any other family strength in the way they pulled together. They\u2019re a great unit.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>The documentary aired on Clare FM at 11am on 22 March, and Flaherty said the station is \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d with the response they have received.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLaura is seen as a hero in this county, and she should always be honoured at that and the texts, the WhatsApps, the emails, the phone calls. They have all been, and it\u2019s very rare that you say this in media and radio, 100% positive,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody has been talking about it and really accepting the work that Laura did, the wonderful work that she did. It\u2019s great for a radio station to be able to put out a documentary that\u2019s so warmly received. So we\u2019re very proud of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Flaherty said that he would like anyone who listens to the documentary to keep Laura and the work that she did in their thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor any of us to do that in our full health should be applauded. But to do that, and to know that the road ahead is going to be very, very difficult, was amazing,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Laura was a fantastic young woman and she went way too early. At 26 years of age, for her to leave this world was tragic, but her work should always be remembered because she saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Her message was heard all over the world, and I think that should always be remembered.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><em>\u2018Laura Brennan, The Voice\u2019 is available to listen to <a

Rotherham United man scored one sensational goal and played a crucial role in the second equaliser late in the game as Ireland battled against Belgium.","content":"<p>HE TOLD US.<\/p>\n<p>He put it all out there before a ball was kicked this week.<\/p>\n<p>There is no subterfuge with Chiedozie Ogbene.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s right there in the open.<\/p>\n<p>The speed, the smile, the quality.<\/p>\n<p>Ireland is falling in love with Chiedozie Ogbene, and there is still so much more to come.<\/p>\n<p>The 24-year-old told us that he is a runner. How he covers about 11 kilometres per game for Rotherham United and how one kilometre of that would be high speed, intense sprinting.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a power athlete,\u201d he said in midweek.<\/p>\n<p>It showed. Oh how it showed, just as this game looked as if it was beginning to drift away from Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>Before we even touch on his sublime overhead goal \u2013 a vision of technical excellence and composure that shows why manager Stephen Kenny insists he can play much higher than League One \u2013 the part he played in setting up Alan Browne\u2019s header five minutes from time to secure a 2-2 draw cannot be underplayed.<\/p>\n<p>It deserves more than to be lost amid the superlatives to describe his goal.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>He watched Matt Doherty stride forward to prevent Belgium passing out from the back easily. The Tottenham Hotspur full back nicked possession of the ball and then played it forward towards the corner flag.<\/p>\n<p>With limbs weary and minds tired, Ogbene remained alert. He sprinted to the ball, kept it in by the finest of threads, then did what every top class player does in big moments.<\/p>\n<p>He lifted his head.<\/p>\n<p>He surveyed what was in front of him in the box. He set himself for the cross, the full back didn\u2019t have the same determination to stop him from delivering, and he did so with pin-point precision, placing the ball on Browne\u2019s head as he strode to meet with equally impressive timing.<\/p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>This is the kind of forward Ireland need, someone capable of leading the line until the last whistle, of making those around him in green believe a chance will come.<\/p>\n<p>The fact he is used as a right wing back by Rotherham just illustrates further his adaptability and intelligence, someone capable of taking instructions and carrying them out, as well as possessing lethal instincts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI knew he would be a real threat,\u201d Stephen Kenny said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a spectacular start to score three goals [in six caps].\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>We see him as a forward player. He just, apart from the goals, he gives us so much. We ask some players to elevate their performances above club form and that\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need them them to do and Chiedozie is doing that.\u201d<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Scoring late goals is not a bad habit to get into.<\/p>\n<p>Kenny\u2019s Ireland are developing one now it seems.<\/p>\n<p>They did so here against Serbia during World Cup qualifying \u2013 netting in the 86th minute, although this one came a few seconds earlier \u2013 and of course this was only a friendly against what was effectively Belgium\u2019s B Team.<\/p>\n<p>But as the Ireland manager sets about instilling a new confidence and belief in this country, this was another indication that he is on the right track.<\/p>\n<p>Unearthing a gem like Ogbene, and providing him with the platform to showcase his ability will only serve to make people care even more about the work being done.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_3\"]<\/p>\n<p>Not that it was perfect.<\/p>\n<p>The visitors had it all their own way for the first 35 minutes. Their goal in the 12th minute through Michy Batshuayi was top class, and just reward for setting the tone early.<\/p>\n<p>But then Ireland showed they\u2019re not a group that will wilt. A trait that will bode well for bigger and more important tests to come this year.<\/p>\n<p>The tone for the first equaliser was set by John Egan being aggressive in his pressing from left centre-back. With Ireland finding rare joy in the attacking third, Callum Robinson then made his first telling contribution of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>The next 14 seconds summed up what he offers, and how his movement his crucial to getting even more from Ireland\u2019s attack.<\/p>\n<p>Robinson turned up on the right flank after Egan\u2019s surge, clipping a ball over for the top for Doherty, who did well to hook a cross into the box.<\/p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_4\"]<\/p>\n<p>The West Brom man didn\u2019t stand and admire his pass. He stayed moving, picking up the ball in the centre 18 yards out and then drifting to the left to stand up a cross to the back post.<\/p>\n<p>Shane Duffy had remained in attack and as his header bounced away from goal it seemed as if the danger was gone. That is when Ogbene came alive, taking one touch to set himself and having the awareness to realise he could, before producing a sublime overhead kick to bring Ireland level.<\/p>\n<p>There was still 10 minutes to go in the first half and his running next stopped.<\/p>\n<p>He went right until the end.<\/p>\n<p>The power athlete with a delicate, ruthless touch.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/www.the42.ie\/ireland-ogbene-5722158-Mar2022\/","shortlink":"https:\/\/the42.ie\/5722158","type":"post","secondary_publications":["thejournal"],"main_story_links":[{"text":"","url":""},{"text":"","url":""}],"categories":{"thescore":{"id":"12","name":"Soccer","slug":"soccer"},"thejournal":{"id":"1","name":"Irish","slug":"irish"}},"publication_data":{"primary":"thescore","all":["thescore","thejournal"],"categories":{"thescore":[{"id":"12","name":"Soccer","slug":"soccer"}],"thejournal":[{"id":"1","name":"Irish","slug":"irish"}]}},"images":{"thumbnail":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-145x145.jpg","width":145,"height":145},"medium":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-296x197.jpg","width":296,"height":197},"large":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-630x420.jpg","width":630,"height":420},"larger":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-744x496.jpg","width":744,"height":496},"river_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-230x150.jpg","width":230,"height":150},"river_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-2300x1500.jpg","width":2300,"height":1500},"river_magazine_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-630x332.jpg","width":630,"height":332},"article_page_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-390x285.jpg","width":390,"height":285},"square_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-390x390.jpg","width":390,"height":390},"square_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-197x197.jpg","width":197,"height":197},"square_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-96x96.jpg","width":96,"height":96},"square_3":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-85x85.jpg","width":85,"height":85},"square_4":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-100x100.jpg","width":100,"height":100},"square_5":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-2000x2000.jpg","width":2000,"height":2000},"main_story_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-630x260.jpg","width":630,"height":260},"main_story_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-210x87.jpg","width":210,"height":87},"main_story_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-290x120.jpg","width":290,"height":120},"super_wide_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-950x260.jpg","width":950,"height":260},"super_wide_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c1.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-290x80.jpg","width":290,"height":80},"listings_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-150x100.jpg","width":150,"height":100},"listings_1":{"image":"https:\/\/c0.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-80x50.jpg","width":80,"height":50},"listings_2":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-225x150.jpg","width":225,"height":150},"listings_3":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200},"listings_4":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-304x203.jpg","width":304,"height":203},"listings_5":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-752x501.jpg","width":752,"height":501},"listings_6":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-310x207.jpg","width":310,"height":207},"offer_large_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-458x298.jpg","width":458,"height":298},"offer_medium_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-298x194.jpg","width":298,"height":194},"offer_small_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-218x140.jpg","width":218,"height":140},"hero_0":{"image":"https:\/\/c3.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal-1366x380.jpg","width":1366,"height":380},"original":{"image":"https:\/\/c2.thejournal.ie\/media\/2022\/03\/chiedozie-ogbene-scores-a-goal.jpg","width":false,"height":false}},"is_short_post":false,"image_data":{"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ben

who \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d after meeting top Ukrainian ministers for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>Biden compared Ukraine\u2019s resistance against Russia to the anti-Soviet \u201cbattle for freedom\u201d and said the world must prepare for a \u201clong fight ahead\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe stand with you,\u201d he told Ukrainians in a sweeping speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, which he began with the words of late Polish pope John Paul II: \u201cBe not afraid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Within minutes of his comments during a visit to Warsaw, a White House official played down the remarks saying Biden \u201cwas not discussing Putin\u2019s power in Russia, or regime change\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe president\u2019s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region,\u201d the official said.<\/p>\n<p>Biden said Russia had suffered a \u201cstrategic failure\u201d in Ukraine and told ordinary Russians they were \u201cnot our enemy\u201d, urging them to blame Putin for the heavy sanctions imposed by the West.<\/p>\n<p>He also warned Russia not to move on an \u201cinch\u201d of NATO territory, reiterating the \u201csacred obligation\u201d of collective defence for alliance members.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will have a different future, a brighter future rooted\u00a0in\u00a0democracy and principle,

growing confidence in the fightback against Russian forces.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting took place at the Marriott Hotel in the city centre \u2014 opposite a Warsaw train station where there has been a constant flow of Ukrainian refugees since the conflict started.<\/p>\n<p>Biden sat at a long white table between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, facing Kuleba and Reznikov, an AFP reporter saw.<\/p>\n<p>There were Ukrainian and US flags in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Kuleba gave Biden the fragment of a Russian missile that struck a base in Yavoriv near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv close to the Polish border.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe invincible character of Ukrainians and Western ones, especially US ones, are the recipe for our victory,\u201d Kuleba said after the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Kuleba said he had discussed new sanctions that could be imposed against Russia and how to ensure the current ones are properly implemented.<\/p>\n<p>Blinken and Austin \u201cpledged continued support to meet Ukraine\u2019s humanitarian, security, and economic needs\u201d, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.<\/p>\n<p>[embed

refugees, including some from the city of Mariupol which has suffered the worst of Russia\u2019s assault.<\/p>\n<p>Asked by reporters what he thought of Putin\u2019s actions, Biden responded simply: \u201cHe\u2019s a butcher.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI remember what it\u2019s like when you have someone in a war zone and every morning you get up and you wonder, you are just wondering, you are praying

North and South poles.<\/p>\n<p>They haven\u2019t quite turned into fire and brimstone just yet, but both the Arctic and Antarctic recorded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/record-temperatures-at-poles-5716916-Mar2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/record-temperatures-at-poles-5716916-Mar2022\/\">major temperature jumps<\/a> in recent days that are well above what\u2019s expected at this time of year.<\/p>\n<p>In Antarctica, temperatures at the Concordia Research Station on Dome C, one of the continent\u2019s tallest summits, were not ten, not twenty, not thirty, but forty degrees above average for March, rising from around -50 to just -11\u00a0Celsius.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s too early to know\u00a0for certain whether climate change is the cause, scientists say the event was extreme and unexpected.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s walk through why it happened and what it means.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Why has this happened?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The basic science behind the heatwaves is the same at the two poles \u2013 warm, moist air travelled to the regions from other parts of the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to <em>The Journal<\/em> for Temperature Check, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth <a href=\"http:\/\/berkeleyearth.org\/author\/rarohde\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http:\/\/berkeleyearth.org\/author\/rarohde\/\">Dr Robert Rohde<\/a> explained that the heatwave in the Arctic was what\u2019s called an\u00a0advection event.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you have warm air from lower latitudes being pushed up into the Arctic by wind patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s large-scale circulation blowing relatively warm air up into the Arctic, in this case, doing so around the North Atlantic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Antarctica, the warm air came south in an \u201catmospheric river\u201d, which is a \u201cband of warm, moisture-saturated air in the atmosphere travelling towards Antarctica\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>So how exactly does this affect temperatures at the poles?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.maynoothuniversity.ie\/faculty-social-sciences\/our-people\/peter-thorne\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.maynoothuniversity.ie\/faculty-social-sciences\/our-people\/peter-thorne\">Professor Peter Thorne<\/a> at Maynooth University has a useful analogy for explaining how warm air at the poles can increase temperatures.<\/p>\n<p>If you think about how much heat it takes to melt your freezer and how much heat it takes to boil the kettle \u2013 that is, to change ice to water or to change water to water vapour \u2013 the process that happens with warm air at the poles is the reverse.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a heat output when you change from water vapour to water and from water to ice, so there\u2019s been a huge amount of energy released by the phase changes of water over Antarctica in particular,\u201d Thorne explained.<\/p>\n<p>For the Arctic, the pattern of warm air in itself is not unusual, though it reached particularly high temperatures this week. It\u2019s a \u201clarge example of a fairly common kind of disturbance\u201d, Dr Rohde said.<\/p>\n<p>Down south, however, it\u2019s a different story. This was an entirely unexpected event for Antarctica that caught researchers by surprise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened in the Antarctic was much more surprising and unusual,\u201d Dr Rohde said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUsually, the air is sort of middling in humidity \u2013 sometimes it gets very full of moisture, you get rain in places.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn this event, you had a lot of moisture from oceans north of Antarctica being pulled through the air and coming ashore in a part of east Antarctica and dumping a lot of moisture into the air above Antarctica.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it was warm, moist air, a lot of that heat was transferred to the surface. You had this moisture transferring warmth to the surface, and doing it very effectively \u2013 to a degree we\u2019ve never seen before in the Antarctic.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At Dome C, one of Antarctica\u2019s tallest summits, he described the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RARohde\/status\/1505867257104187403?s=20&amp;t=P7I5ACI7FGPQCQkuP3pyXQ\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RARohde\/status\/1505867257104187403?s=20&amp;t=P7I5ACI7FGPQCQkuP3pyXQ\">record-beating <\/a>nature of the temperature as \u201castonishingly large\u201d<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With a temperature around 40 degrees Celsius higher than usual, it beat the previous record for March by more than 20 degrees Celsius.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Professor Peter Thorne noted that though the event in the Arctic \u201cmay not be as noteworthy or as unusual\u201d as the event in Antarctica, it could signify the start of a longer period of unseasonable weather.<\/p>\n<p>There may be a lower area covered by ice in the Arctic by the end of the summer this year \u2013 \u201cbut of course, we\u2019ve got six months of weather to happen between now and then that might either put a stop to a melt or accelerate the melt\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Arctic has been warm for weeks and weeks and weeks, unseasonably warm. So it\u2019s possible that we will see a significant story unfold later in the summer \u2013 possible, but far from certain.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Is it down to climate change?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cSeemingly, we have not seen this in the 60-odd years that we have on record in Antarctica, so it\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d said Professor Thorne.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut whether that\u2019s climate change is unclear.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we now get increasing numbers of those types of events in Antarctica, then we would very rapidly come to the view that it must be climate change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut a single extraordinary event like that? We can\u2019t pin\u00a0its occurrence, at least, on climate change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr Robert Rohde is on the same page.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are very many people in the scientific community who are prepared to say this is definitely climate change, because, particularly in the Antarctic, we\u2019ve seen this one time, and one time does not make for very good statistics,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we need to have a better understanding of what just happened because it was very surprising.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn analogy I\u2019ve made before is to say that sometimes there are rare weather events that until you\u2019ve seen them, you don\u2019t expect them. If you were sitting in a coastal city and you had never seen a hurricane before \u2013 you might go 50 years without ever seeing a hurricane \u2013 and suddenly, a hurricane comes ashore, it changes your perceptions about what\u2019s possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_3\"]<\/p>\n<p>Overall, it\u2019s well-documented that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/climate-change-crisis-report-un-ipcc-global-warming-emissions-5518512-Aug2021\/?jrnl_lg=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/climate-change-crisis-report-un-ipcc-global-warming-emissions-5518512-Aug2021\/?jrnl_lg=1\">human influence on the climate<\/a> is unsettling global weather patterns, pushing up average temperatures, and increasing the likelihood, frequency and severity of extreme weather events.<\/p>\n<p>Closer to home \u2013 separate to the polar events \u2013 Ireland has faced particularly\u00a0warm weather this week, with Met \u00c9ireann recording temperatures of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.met.ie\/latest-reports\/observations\/yesterday\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.met.ie\/latest-reports\/observations\/yesterday\">up to 18.5 degrees<\/a> yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>A single warm spell\u00a0may or may not be due to climate change \u2013 but overall, we know that average temperatures in Ireland are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/winter-weather-climate-change-ireland-5636135-Dec2021\/?jrnl_lg=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/winter-weather-climate-change-ireland-5636135-Dec2021\/?jrnl_lg=1\">rising at all times of the year<\/a> compared to the past.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe shoulder seasons, spring and autumn, are always variable,\u201d said Thorne, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is \u201cvery, very clear\u201d that abnormal weather can occur at any time of year.<\/p>\n<p>He said the weather this week is a \u201csignificant departure from the seasonal expectation\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHeatwaves have been made both more frequent and more severe
