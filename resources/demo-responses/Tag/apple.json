    "content": "<p><em><strong>Updated 5.10pm</strong></em></p>\n<p>AS PLANNING SAGAS tend to do in Ireland, Apple’s battle to build a data centre in Athenry is dragging on and on.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2015, the US tech giant applied for permission to build a large data centre in a forest near the Galway town. Almost three years on and a final decision on planning is still pending.</p>\n<p>It looks like Apple might be finally getting fed up. Yesterday the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/apple-is-said-to-warn-ireland-delays-threaten-1-billion-project\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg news agency reported</a> that the company has warned Irish officials that the lengthy delays could jeopardise the future of the project.</p>\n<p>Speaking to <em>TheJournal.ie</em> today, East Galway TD Seán Canney said reports questioning Apple’s commitment to Athenry are incorrect.</p>\n<p>He said he spoke to Leo Varadkar this morning, noting the Taoiseach confirmed he was in contact with Apple executives last week.</p>\n<p>“They confirmed to him that they are still committed to the project in Athenry. Apple have expressed their concerns in the delays which is understandable, but the bottom line is Apple are still committed to the project in Athenry.</p>\n<p>“I will continue to work with the people of Athenry and all the State agencies and the Taoiseach to ensure delivery of this project,” Canney said.</p>\n<p>So why has one of the biggest companies in the world struggled so much to get what should be a fairly straightforward project over the line?</p>\n<p>Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happened so far.</p>\n<p><strong>February 2015</strong></p>\n<p>Apple announces it will apply for planning permission from Galway County Council to build a data centre on a greenfield site in Derrydonnell, near Athenry.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that it would cost €850 million to develop the site, and between 100 and 150 people would work at the centre upon its completion.</p>\n<p>The site covers a space the size of about 23 soccer fields. It would be the single biggest private sector investment in Connacht, and was welcomed by many locals.</p>\n<p>At the same time, plans for a similar facility in Denmark were revealed. It was intended that both would be operational by 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>June 2015</strong></p>\n<p>Galway County Council says it needs more detail from Apple about its plans. It was intended that the centre would be completely powered by renewable energy. The council was concerned about how this would work.</p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]</p>\n<p><strong>September 2015</strong></p>\n<p>Galway County Council grants planning permission for the data centre.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_3\"]</p>\n<p>Almost immediately objections are lodged with An Bord Pleanála by eight objectors. Most complain about the negative environmental impact the data centre could have.</p>\n<p><strong>May 2016</strong></p>\n<p>After requesting more information on the issue, An Bord Pleanála holds an oral hearing to hear all arguments for and against the data centre.</p>\n<p><strong>August 2016</strong></p>\n<p>An Bord Pleanála grants Apple planning permission to build the data centre. In response to environmental concerns, the body said that the facility ”would not seriously injure the amenities of the area or of property in the vicinity”.</p>\n<p><strong>October 2016</strong></p>\n<p>Three people apply for a judicial review of An Bord Pleanála’s decision on environmental grounds, saying the data centre could destroy the local forest. These are local residents Allan Daly and Sinéad Fitzpatrick and Wicklow resident and landowner Brian McDonagh.</p>\n<p><strong>November 2016</strong></p>\n<p>Residents in Athenry, most of whom are in favour of the proposal, demonstrate in favour of Apple. More than 2,000 people attend a rally in support of the plan to build a data centre near the town, which has a total population of about 4,000 residents.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p><strong>February 2017</strong></p>\n<p>Brian McDonagh’s objections are dismissed, however Allan Daly and Sinéad Fitzpatrick’s applications for a judicial review are successful.</p>\n<p>The case is fast-tracked and is due to be heard in the Commercial Court in March.</p>\n<p><strong>June 2017</strong></p>\n<p>After Justice Paul McDermott reserved his judgment in March, it was anticipated that a final decision would be made on the project near the end of June. This is delayed again, and a ruling is expected at the end of July.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Apple announces it is building a second data centre in Denmark. This followed its completion of its first data centre in the country, plans for which were announced on the same day as the centre in Galway.</p>\n<p><strong>July 2017</strong></p>\n<p>The decision is postponed again, and is now scheduled to be heard on 12 October when it is expected that a final judgement will be delivered.</p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://fora.ie/mailing-list\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up to our newsletter to receive a regular digest of Fora’s top articles delivered to your inbox.</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Written by Paul O’Donoghue and posted on <a href=\"https://fora.ie\">Fora.ie</a>, with additional reporting by Órla Ryan and Christina Finn</em></p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]</p>\n<span id='subscription-link'></span>",

    "excerpt": "The government has spent €1.7m on legal fees this year alone.",
    "content": "<p>IRELAND HAS SPENT over €3.6 million on legal costs, consultancy fees and other associated costs to fight the European Commission’s finding that Apple owes the State €13 billion in back taxes.</p>\n<p>A briefing note from the Department of Finance reveals that these monies were paid by the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office to well-known law and accounting firms.</p>\n<p>Ireland was found to have given the iPhone maker a selective advantage over a period of more than two decades that allowed it to pay effective tax rates as low as 0.005% on profits from sales in Europe and several other territories.</p>\n<p><strong>Appeal case </strong></p>\n<p>The case is focused on two Irish-registered companies, one of which was used as a “head office” despite having no staff and being effectively stateless for tax purposes. Ireland denies the profits assigned to the head office should have been taxed in the Republic.</p>\n<p>The government has appealed the ruling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-tax-affairs-ruling-2953734-Aug2016/\">Explainer: Why doesn’t the government want Apple to cough up extra taxes?</a>&gt;</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details of the payments due, which were racked up between 2013 and 25 August 2017 and seen by <em>TheJournal.ie</em>, show that amounts, some well over €500,000, are being paid out to senior counsel, junior counsel, law firms, tax firms and accountancy firms. Payments have also been made to get technical documents translated.</p>\n<p>This time last year, the government was dealing with a crisis over the Apple tax ruling, which forced it to return from summer holidays early in order to debate the issue.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>The appeal to the ruling was lodged last year, resulting in Ireland paying some €1,002,124 in fees fighting the case in 2016 alone.</p>\n<p>To date, in 2017, the government has paid out €1,775,692 in fees. This is a significant increase from the €182,061 paid out in 2014, and €659,890 paid in 2015.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, a report about Ireland’s corporation tax code found there was no preferential tax regime for any one company.</p>\n<p>The report, which was carried out by economics lecturer and Irish Fiscal Advisory Council member, Seamus Coffey, was ordered after there were differences in opinions among <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/independent-alliance-cruel-promises-2961244-Sep2016/\">some independent ministers who sit at the Cabinet table</a>.</p>\n<p>While the terms of reference didn’t specifically mention Apple, it looked at Ireland’s tax transparency, and investigated if any one company was given preferential treatment.</p>\n<p>“Apple may have provided some of the context to this report but the terms of reference did not pay any particular reference to any particular case and from the work Seamus has done. He concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that Ireland offered any preferential tax treatment to any one company,” Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Sinn Féin finance spokesperson, Pearse Doherty, told <em>TheJournal.ie </em>that the latest figures show how much potential for runaway costs the Apple case brings with it.</p>\n<p>“This is only a sneak preview of what the final bill will look like. €1.75 million this year alone and it’s only September tells us how the final bill will be in the multiples of the €3.6 million already spent.</p>\n<p>“Let’s not forget Apple are entitled to mount their own appeal. That is their right but for Ireland, as a State with a housing and health service crisis, to spend millions in aiding them makes no sense,” he said.</p>\n<p>He added:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>By engaging in this appeal, the government is writing a blank cheque for lawyers and legal companies to try to overturn a Commission decision that Ireland is owed €13 billion plus. It is a completely unjustifiable use of taxpayer’s money.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>The gravy train should be stopped now before it costs the Irish people any more millions of money desperately need in other areas.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-tax-appeal-spend-pwc-2-3243744-Feb2017/\">Ireland spent €440k on a report defending Apple months before the EU’s scathing tax ruling</a>&gt;</h3>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-tax-ireland-fund-3511828-Jul2017/\">Ireland is looking for someone to hold onto the €15 billion from Apple’s tax bill</a>&gt;</h3>\n",

    "excerpt": "There was quite a reaction to the new iPhone&#8217;s price tag of $999.",
    "content": "<p>TECH COMPANY APPLE has released the details of its new smartphone, <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/iphone-x-price-3594698-Sep2017/\">the iPhone X</a> – which is pronounced as ‘ten’, not ‘x’ by the way, to commemorate ten years since the first iPhone’s release.</p>\n<p>Among the new phone’s features are face recognition software that’s used to unlock the phone, improved cameras and durable glass, according to Apple.</p>\n<p>But it’s not the tech features that caught our eye – it’s the price of the new gadget. Apple has already raised the price since its last model, the iPhone 7, from $815 to $999, which is its pre-tax price (and equivalent to €833.99).</p>\n<p>But the price of buying the phone in Ireland isn’t €833.99. It will cost €1,179, almost a third more expensive than buying it in the US. Even after taxes are added to the US price, it’s still a stark price difference.</p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]</p>\n<p>The bump isn’t unique to Ireland: iPhone prices vary around the world. In Canada, the new phone is almost $100 (€83.50) more expensive than in the US. In France, Germany, Russia, and New Zealand, it’s around $300 more expensive (again, this is compared to its pre-tax US price).</p>\n<p>It’s not the first time that iPhone prices have shown such discrepancies. <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/ranked-what-an-iphone-7-costs-in-33-countries-2017-5\">Business Insider</a> previously compiled a list of the price of iPhones around the world and compared it to the US price.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_3\"]</p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons cited for the gap in costs: one of which is currency fluctuations. But that doesn’t explain why there are such differences within EU member states, which share the euro.</p>\n<p>But Apple Inc also has a history of charging more for their products in countries that have a high average income, disposable income, or other factors based on market research.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>Although Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research called the iPhone X “a far bigger upgrade” than previous devices, he questioned whether Apple was stretching its market too thin.</p>\n<p>“What Apple doesn’t want is for people to want the best but not be able to afford it and therefore hold onto their existing phones rather than buying what they consider second best,” Dawson said in <a href=\"https://jackdawresearch.com/bio/\">a blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Other tech experts and commentators say that iPhone fans are very loyal and unlikely to switch devices, so the company can afford to stretch its prices.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]</p>\n<p>The unveiling of three new Apple products last night comes as the company seeks to recapture the success of its first iPhone release in 2007 as it struggles to maintain its market share.</p>\n<p><em>- With reporting from AFP and Business Insider.</em></p>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-cork-protest-3594429-Sep2017/\">‘We didn’t realise it would be this bad’: Cork locals protest against Apple’s building works</a>\n</h3>\n",

    "content": "<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]</p>\n<p>LOCALS IN THE Ardcullen area of Cork held a demonstration outside the site of tech giant Apple yesterday, protesting against the disruption that building work is having on the community.</p>\n<p>Apple received planning permission for an expansion of its European headquarters in Cork last August, after an appeal from some local residents was dismissed.</p>\n<p>The company is in the process of building a four-storey office block, with room for an additional 1,000 staff.</p>\n<p>Speaking to <em>TheJournal.ie</em>, protest organiser Jackie McKeown said that the last 13 months, in particular, of building work at the site had been “hectic”.</p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_2\"]</p>\n<p>She said: “It’s right on our doorsteps. We didn’t have a problem with the building, as such. We don’t want to interfere with employment in our area.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>The protest is about how we didn’t realise it was going to be this bad.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So how has the local community been affected?</p>\n<p>“It’s a combination of things,” McKeown said. “There’s the noise, the dust, how close the building is to our home.</p>\n<p>“The drilling is constant. When my children get up in the morning and I’m making them toast, the toaster does be rocking with the sound of the drill. It does be going all day. Cracks have appeared in the walls of some houses too.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>And the dust just gets everywhere. It covers whole cars sometimes. And sometimes we can’t open windows because the dust gets in and goes all over the place.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]</p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_3\"]</p>\n<p>Locals have met with Apple representatives on a number of occasions, but felt that these meetings did little to fix their problems.</p>\n<p>McKeown did say, however, that Apple had offered to clean the windows of homes in the area during the summer, and had offered to paint a number of houses in the immediate vicinity to the site.</p>\n<p>“But that’s not good enough,” she said. “It’s caused so much disruption, and that’s set to continue. We’re looking for some sort of compensation package.”</p>\n<p>Even when the project is completed, the four-storey building and its lights will loom large around the local community which has predominantly two-storey houses, McKeown added.</p>\n<p>Apple did not provide a response following a request for comment from <em>TheJournal.ie</em>.</p>\n<p>However, it is understood that the company is not stockpiling soil on site in order to keep the dust levels down.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, hoarding, screening and acoustic barriers have been installed at the site.</p>\n<p>In its environmental impact statement lodged with Cork City Council at the time of the planning permission application, Apple said that “it is possible that if the development did not go ahead, there would be a potential serious negative impact on the local and national economy”.</p>\n<p>Solidarity-PBP TD Mick Barry told <em>TheJournal.ie</em>: “I do not believe that the actions of Apple towards their neighbours, the residents of Ardcullen have been the actions of good neighbours.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I believe the residents have suffered in silence for quite some time now. I think it is a positive thing that they are finding their voice and I am happy to support their campaign.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>The group of locals peacefully protested outside with placards yesterday evening, and plan to do so again next Monday.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to make our voices heard,” McKeown added.</p>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/cyber-crime-dark-web-health-details-3588618-Sep2017/\">‘Did you know your electronic health records can sell for as much as €40 on the dark web?’</a>\n</h3>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/new-website-ie-3567222-Aug2017/\">Want to set up a .ie website?

    "content": "<p>THE IPOD TOUCH became the last iPod standing today as Apple removed nano and shuffle devices from its lineup.</p>\n<p>The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the devices 12 years ago and the small, easy-to-operate players helped the company revolutionise how music was sold.</p>\n<p>Apple confirmed to AFP that it is no longer selling nano and shuffle, and the MP3 players vanished from the Apple website.</p>\n<p>“Today, we are simplifying our iPod lineup with two models of iPod touch now with double the capacity starting at just $199 (€170) and we are discontinuing the iPod shuffle and iPod nano,” the company said in an email.</p>\n<p>Industry trackers and Apple itself have long acknowledged that the do-it-all iPhone would eat away at sales of one-trick devices such as iPod MP3 players, so the farewell was met more with nostalgia than surprise.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>The trend toward streaming music services, including the launch of one by Apple, has made devices designed just for carrying digital tunes around less enticing for consumers.</p>\n<p>Shuffle devices, about the size of matchbooks and featuring click-wheels for control, debuted in early 2005, with Jobs touting that they let people carry broad libraries of music right in their pockets.</p>\n<p>The iPod nano also hit the market in 2005, featuring click wheels and screens that improved the ability to select songs. Nano devices evolved with subsequent models, leading to one with a multi-touch screen and the look of an iPhone.</p>\n<p>Neither the shuffle nor the nano linked to the internet, instead relying on downloading music from Apple online shop iTunes through computers.</p>\n<p>Three years ago Apple discontinued the last version of the original iPod classic, introduced in October of 2001.</p>\n<p>The remaining products in the line are iPod touch models boasting much larger storage capacity and the ability to link wirelessly to internet hotspots for online content such as music streamed from services such as Apple Music.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.afp.com/en\">© – AFP, 2017</a></em></p>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/execution-wikipedia-texas-3518503-Jul2017/\">Man executed in Texas despite last-ditch claims lawyer defended him using Wikipedia for research&gt;</a>\n</h3>\n",

    "excerpt": "The outcome of a judicial review of the plans has been put back until October. ",
    "content": "<p>LOCALS AND POLITICIANS have voiced serious concerns that a planned €850 million Apple data centre in Athenry could be scrapped because of planning delays.</p>\n<p>An Bord Pleanála granted permission for the data centre on the 166,000 square metre site in mid-2016, but the decision of a judicial review which will determine whether or not it goes ahead has now been put back until October.</p>\n<p>The judicial review was first granted last November. Locals who have been campaigning for the investment will now have to wait until 17 October to hear the High Court’s decision.</p>\n<p>Apple’s decision to locate the centre in a greenfield site in a Coillte-owned forest was <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-athenry-jobs-data-centre-850-m-investment-1954306-Feb2015/\">first announced more than two years ago</a> when the tech giant announced a similar investment in Denmark.</p>\n<p>The Danish centre is slated to open later this year but the Galway campus is mired in delays.</p>\n<p>Galway TD and Minister of State for Community and Digital Development Seán Kyne says this latest delay shows just how slow the planning process here.</p>\n<p>“In comparison to other countries, clearly there were issues with delays here on a lot of levels, which is very worrying compared to Denmark where a similar announcement was made by Apple on the same day and their campus will be open later this year,” Kyne told <em>TheJournal.ie</em>, adding that the delay throws the whole project into doubt.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The concern is that this would cause Apple to reconsider their decision. Obviously they’ve invested a lot of time and money in this and it’s hugely important for Galway. It’s hugely important to the local authorities in terms of future rates but more importantly, in terms of earmarking that area  for future investment by other companies.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The judicial review has come about on foot of objections on environmental grounds from two locals, Allan Daly and property lawyer Sineád Fitzpatrick.</p>\n<p>Initial objections were based on potential traffic problems and fears about how construction might affect nearby badgers and bats, which are protected species.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]</p>\n<p>After considering their complaints at an oral hearing, An Bord Pleanála decided to green-light construction on the site with “revised conditions”. Objections continued however and the judicial review was granted almost nine months ago.</p>\n<p>The objections to the data centre led to some locals who are in favour of the plans forming their own campaign group to show their support for the development.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>The Athenry for Apple campaign group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/athenryforapple/\">has close to 4,000 members on Facebook</a> and has held a number of rallies in the town.</p>\n<p>The group has now voiced its dismay at the fresh delay.</p>\n<p>“It’s a disaster,” according to campaigner Paul Keane.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>It puts it more at risk that we will lose a billion-dollar investment in the west of Ireland. Who’ll want to come after Apple have been turned away?They’ve already gone ahead [and started to] build a second plant out in Denmark. Athenry was meant to be built first with a sister site in Denmark but they’ve got a second site in Denmark, and although they say that it’s not a replacement it’s still within the European boundaries and that’s what they wanted.\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Keane says jobs and investment are the main reasons supporters want the data centre built but that they were particularly in favour of it because it is a “relatively clean industry” that could lead to further high-tech jobs.</p>\n<p>The Galway data centre would be used to store information for Apple’s online services like iTunes, Siri and iMessage.</p>\n<p>Minister of State Kyne also adds that it would be “hugely worrying” for the country as a whole if the investment was lost because of planning delays.</p>\n<p>“I mean it was fully examined by the competent authority and planning authority and that has passed, so I think everyone thought it would go forward to the construction phase,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"https://fora.ie/apple-data-centre-galway-2-3061011-Nov2016/\">Your crash course in… How three people stand in the way of Apple’s €850m Athenry investment &gt;</a>\n</h3>\n<h3>Read: <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/apple-athenry-rally-3066598-Nov2016/\">“Apple in or lights out”: Hundreds turn out for pro-Apple rally in Galway &gt;</a>\n</h3>\n",

    "content": "<p>MUCH LIKE THE this year’s NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were in trouble after the first two games of the 2016 Finals.</p>\n<p>The defending Golden State Warriors had crushed them in the first two games, winning Game 2 by a humiliating 33 points. The Cavs were about to play at home for the first time in the series, and LeBron James wasn’t having it, according to a report at the time by <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16390925/nba-playoffs-2016-how-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-lifted-curse\">ESPN</a>.</p>\n<p>Prior to Game 3, LeBron gathered the team in the locker room beforehand. And then he turned to what might seem an unusual source of inspiration: Apple founder Steve Jobs.</p>\n<p>James played a portion of the speech Jobs delivered to the Stanford University graduating class of 2005.</p>\n<p>It’s an amazing speech, and you can watch or read the whole thing below. But the part James played was about ”connecting the dots,” the first of three stories Jobs told in the speech. The advice was do a lot of things that you’re interested in even if they don’t make sense at the time, carry the lessons you learn forward, and combine them to become a greater person in all parts of your life.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]</p>\n<p>It worked.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the Cavs’ Richard Jefferson listened to the speech and reflected on how he was only in the Finals because he decided not to sign with the Dallas Mavericks over the off-season, even though the Mavs offered him more money. Kevin Love had been reading up on Jobs separately, and had recently ordered a t-shirt with the famous line from Jobs’ speech: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”</p>\n<p>The Cavs dominated the Warriors in Game 3, before losing again in Game 4. Then, the team made history by winning the last three games — the first time in NBA history a team has won the Finals after being down 3-1 — and delivered the city of Cleveland its first major sports championship since 1964.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t watched the Jobs speech, check it out here, or read the full transcript below.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>Here’s the transcript if you don’t have time to watch it:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>“I am honoured to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>The first story is about connecting the dots.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5Â¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/windows?utm_source=thejournal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=partner\">Windows</a> just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>My second story is about love and loss.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I was lucky – I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/apple?utm_source=thejournal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=partner\">Apple</a> in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation – the Macintosh – a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down – that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/david-packard?utm_source=thejournal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=partner\">David Packard</a> and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me – I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>During the next five years, I started a company named <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/next?utm_source=thejournal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=partner\">NeXT</a>, another company named <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/pixar?utm_source=thejournal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=partner\">Pixar</a>, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>My third story is about death.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>When I was young, there was an amazing publication called <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960’s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/google?utm_source=thejournal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=partner\">Google</a> in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Stewart and his team put out several issues of <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>Thank you all very much.”</div>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.the42.ie/cork-tipperary-football-2-3433697-Jun2017/\">Hit hard by absentees, Cork and Tipp set for Munster rematch with final prize at stake</a></h3>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.the42.ie/ireland-caps-quiz-3431889-Jun2017/\">Can you tell which Ireland player has the most caps?</a></h3>\n",

    "content": "<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]</p>\n<p>APPLE USERS DEFINITELY have a love-hate relationship with the company. On one hand, the phones are undeniably nice to use. There are people who could never buy an Android and leave Apple’s emojis, iMessage or Facetime behind.</p>\n<p>But there’s no denying that there are a whole host of problems, including terrible charging cables, extremely fragile screens and users feeling completely locked into the products because of a number of features that make changing phone extremely tedious.</p>\n<p>It seems that while we have a huge host of issues that Apple needs to get working on (creating more durable screens that don’t cost €200 to replace and phones that are properly waterproof) they just feel like kicking back in Silicon Valley and dreaming up products that most people don’t care about. Exhibit A:</p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_1\"]</p>\n<h3>But now they’re taking it to another level.</h3>\n<p>Don’t get us wrong, we’re well aware that you can focus on two things at once and that this, by far, isn’t the companies biggest priority. But do we really need a round pizza box?</p>\n<p>This week <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/05/apple-park-new-silicon-valley-campus/\">Wired</a> got an exclusive look at Apple’s new Silicon Valley campus. They described it as “Flawless curves. Milled aluminium. Endless glass. Walled garden. Sounds like an Apple product”. Since when does the iPhone give you a walled garden?</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_5\"]</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]</p>\n<h3>What stood out to most readers in this sneak peek was the fact that the article revealed a newly patented Apple pizza box.</h3>\n<p>Here it is:</p>\n<p>[image id=\"image_2\"]</p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>For workers who want to take the café’s pizza back to their pods, Apple created (and patented) a container that lets air and moisture escape so the crust won’t get soggy.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In one way, it makes sense. It’s easy to wonder why pizza boxes are square in the first place, but obviously it has made more sense logistically for them to be flattened to take up minimal space.</p>\n<p>Have you ever seen how many they go through in the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tallaght-is-pizza-capital-of-the-world-9fcr7r2lh6z\">pizza capital of the world</a>, Dominos in Tallaght? Apple’s circular containers look like they would take up slightly more space, even when stacked.</p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_3\"]</p>\n<h3>How is this innovative? There’s nowhere to even put a garlic sauce.</h3>\n<p>Like some of Apple’s other moves (insert passive aggressive mention of the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack) this seems to make no sense.</p>\n<p>In the same Wired interview, they brag about having the capability to product the largest pieces of glass in the world (which they plan to do on their campus), yet somehow they can’t share the goods and offer us an affordable way to fix cracked screens without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/05/error-53-apple-iphone-software-update-handset-worthless-third-party-repair\">risking bricking our phones</a>.</p>\n<h3>DailyEdge is on Snapchat!
